# Paperless NG Role Configuration
###############################################################################
# Electronic Document Management System.
#
# Suggested Use (based on archivst recommendations):
#
# 1. **Document Types** refer to the broad type of document in question. Is it
#    a letter? Receipt? Bill? Every instance will be different, but this should
#    be your broadest field. You just want to more of less get it in the
#    ballpark. For example, my Receipts doctype holds receipts that I scan in,
#    but it will also hold confirmations from my debtors that I paid a bill, or
#    an email from Cash app that I sold Bitcoin.
#
# 2. **Correspondent** refers to the person/organization you are communicating
#    with in the document. A bill from your credit card would have Capital One
#    as correspondent for example, while a copy of your W2 might go under IRS.
#    Again, you can be broad here, as trying to narrow it down is going to
#    drive you crazy.
#
# 3. **Tags** are used to answer the below basic concepts:
#
#   * **Who** is it referring to? In my case, I have tags for myself, my wife,
#     the kids, and the dogs. They are all the same color to easily denote
#     that. Note that this is NOT the same as correspondent.
#
#   * **What** is it referring to? Is it related to your car loan? Is it
#     related to your homes maintenance? Mark these tags in a different color
#     to easily notice them.
#
#   * **When** is the information in this document relevant? Was it a bill from
#     2 years ago? Does it relate to your taxes for 2022? Personally, I make
#     tags for the year it was received, as it makes it easier to sort. You can
#     further break this down by month if needed.
#
# 4. I also make tags for special categories that I need to track. For example,
#    I have a tag for any documents that we'll need for our taxes in the coming
#    year, or critical documents (birth certs, etc). This helps to further
#    break it down.

# How to performce OCR document scanning. Default 'skip'.
# * skip:
#     Skip all pages and perform OCR only on pages where no text present. This
#     is the safest option.
# * skip_noarchive:
#     In addition to 'skip', paperless won’t create an archived version of your
#     documents when it finds any text in them. This is useful if you don’t
#     want to have two almost-identical versions of your digital documents in
#     the media folder. This is the fastest option.
# * redo:
#     Paperless will OCR all pages of your documents and attempt to replace any
#     existing text layers with new text. This will be useful for documents
#     from scanners that already performed OCR with insufficient results. It
#     will also perform OCR on purely digital documents. This option may fail
#     on some documents that have features that cannot be removed, such as
#     forms. In this case, the text from the document is used instead.
# * force:
#     Paperless rasterizes your documents, converting any text into images and
#     puts the OCRed text on top. This works for all documents, however, the
#     resulting document may be significantly larger and text won’t appear as
#     sharp when zoomed in.
